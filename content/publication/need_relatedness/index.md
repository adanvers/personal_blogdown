abstract: "Hamilton’s rule predicts that altruism should depend on costs incurred and benefits provided, but
  these depend on the relative needs of the donor and recipient. Rewriting Hamilton’s rule to account for
  relative need suggests an amplifying effect of need on relatedness, but not necessarily other relationship
  qualities. In a reanalysis of three studies of social discounting and a new replication, we find that relative
  need amplifies the effects of relatedness on giving in two samples of U.S. adults recruited online, but not
  U.S. undergraduates or Indian adults recruited online. Among U.S. online participants, the effect of genetic
  kinship was greater when the partner was perceived to be in higher need than when in lower need. In the other
  samples, relatedness was associated with greater giving and greater need, but the effect of relatedness was
  not significantly amplified by need. Need never amplified the effect of social closeness on giving, although
  it did diminish the effect of closeness in U.S. undergraduates, likely reflecting a ceiling effect. These
  results confirm predictions from a modification of Hamilton’s rule in a sample of U.S. adults, but raise
  important questions about why they hold in some samples but not others. They also illustrate the importance of
  understanding how contextual factors, such as relative need, can moderate the importance of common variables
  used in evolutionary cost-benefit analyses."

summary: Among U.S. adults, need and relatedness have a synergistic effect on giving, a prediction that can be
  derived from a model of inclusive fitness.
