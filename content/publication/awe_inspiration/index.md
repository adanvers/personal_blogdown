abstract: The emotions (awe, elevation) and emotional state (inspiration) addressed in this chapter are thought
  to turn our minds outward rather than inward, encouraging us to transcend the self and its expectations. While
  they differ from each other in important ways, awe, elevation, and inspiration all involve challenging our
  expectations about what is and what can be. They pull attention outside the self toward something to be
  understood and appreciatedâ€”a feature of the natural world, the actions of another human being, a practical or
  creative problem to be solved. Moreover, they draw attention to that which is greater than the self, inviting
  us to transcend our day-to-day agendas and limits. In this chapter we discuss each of these three constructs,
  offering a detailed theoretical description, as well as reviewing the available empirical evidence. We then
  discuss broader issues raised by awe, elevation, and inspiration, offering suggestions for future research on
  these relatively understudied states.
