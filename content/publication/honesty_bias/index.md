abstract: "Psychological and philosophical discussions typically understand honesty as reporting truth with
  propositional statements. In this model, emotions are often seen as irrelevant or a hindrance to honesty,
  because they can bias our reports. In relational contexts, however, emotions can provide information about
  deep-seated convictions. We report the results of a study (N = 827) finding that individuals whose emotional
  responses are congruent with their explicitly stated egalitarian positions are judged as significantly more
  honest and less prejudiced than those with incongruent emotional responses. This is seen in judgments of white
  male targets who have negative emotional responses to a black man, a gay man, and a female supervisor. These
  results suggest that emotional reactions provide information used when judging the honesty and bias of an
  individual."

summary: If a person has a negative emotional reaction to an outgroup member, his commitments to non-racist,
  non-homophobic, and non-sexist values are viewed as less honest.
