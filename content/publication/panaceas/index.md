abstract: "While positive emotion can be conceptualized broadly as a response to the potential for reward, the
  environment offers different kinds of rewards, and these are best approached in somewhat different ways. A
  functional approach to positive emotion differentiation distinguishes among several different types of rewards
  with strong implications for adaptive fitness and posits the existence of 'discrete' positive emotions that
  promote an adaptive response to each reward. A taxonomy of eight positive emotions, dubbed the 'PANACEAS'
  taxonomy based on an acronym of the first letter of each of the eight constructs, is presented as an example
  of this approach. Positive emotion constructs defined through functional analyses are useful for guiding
  empirical research, especially for identifying prototypical eliciting stimuli, and generating hypotheses about
  the implications of different positive emotions for a variety of outcomes. Research findings are reviewed that
  support the importance of positive emotion differentiation in understanding the effects of positive emotions
  on cognition, physiology, and behavior. Advantages of the functional approach are discussed, as well as
  implications of the approach for evaluating major theories of the structure of emotion."
