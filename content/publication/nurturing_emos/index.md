abstract: "Caregiving for oneâ€™s offspring and young kin facilitates the evolutionary goal of successful
  reproduction. In this chapter we define an emotional state of nurturant love, elicited by cues of cuteness and
  helplessness, which activates a suite of physiological, cognitive, and behavioral changes facilitating
  caregiving toward the eliciting target. We review the literature pertaining to the elicitors and function of
  nurturant love, compare and contrast this emotion to other affective states that may promote caregiving,
  discuss empirical evidence regarding the properties and behavioral consequences of nurturant love, and
  conclude with potential future directions for research in this area."
