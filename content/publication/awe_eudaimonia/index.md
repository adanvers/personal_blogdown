abstract: 'The eudaimonic approach to well-being proposes that, in contrast to simply seeking pleasure and 
  avoiding pain, a good life involves acting with excellence on oneâ€™s personal life projects. Our research
  suggests that beyond being subjectively pleasant, positive emotions promote the accomplishment of important
  life goals, and can therefore facilitate meeting our eudaimonic needs. Because eudaimonia is inherently
  multi-faceted, different positive emotions may support different aspects of eudaimonic well-being. As an
  example, we propose that one positive emotion, awe, may promote a particular aspect of eudaimonia: the sense
  of having meaning in life, a personal, coherent conceptual framework that helps individuals define who they
  are and what is most important to them. Existential philosophy emphasizes the role of conscious analysis in
  developing a meaning framework, and we suggest that powerful awe experiences facilitate a cognitive and
  motivational mindset that is especially conducive to this personal work. Implications and suggestions for
  future research are discussed.'
